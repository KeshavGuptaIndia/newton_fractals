#Newton Fractals!
Read about the program here: http://www.keshlabs.in/uncategorized/digital-rangoli-newton-fractals-actually/

Compile the main.cpp file (including bmp_write.h) after changing the plotting parameters. I am working on a way to provide the plotting parameters directly to a precompiled executable.

Hope you like my work! Give feedback at: info@keshlabs.in
